The first goal of this project is to apply the acquired knowledge in practice and gain the necessary experience.

In our time, there are a lot of still unresolved problems that arise every day, and to solve them, science and research are needed, which is aimed at understanding and substantiating knowledge. Therefore, scientific articles and research today remain an integral part of the scientific infrastructure. Being engaged in scientific activity, a person first receives a huge amount of information that has already been published, then, using the experience of previous researchers, he is looking for a solution to a specific problem. 

On the World Wide Web, you can find a very large number of studies, among them those that have not been officially published, as well as those that are not at all useful in promoting science. 

Studying one topic, it is impossible not only to analyse all previous works, but also to find well-done works. And young researchers who are just starting their way in science do not know where to start and in what areas they actively conduct research. That's why we settled on the topic about Education

We offer a solution that helps young scientists quickly and easily choose a scientific job. Thus, after sorting and collecting the database, we are going to make an analysis that will allow us to determine in which year which works were more relevant. In this way, we believe that it will be easier for scientists to know the trends and years of scientific work.

We wanted to explore the research that exists that would help everyone to apply it in their practice, for example, for a dissertation, or for a project.

At a meeting with the team, after a long search for the site, they settled on https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/ . Because it meets our needs and requirements. Let's start with the fact that the site has a lot of data. This allows users to have a wide range of choices. Secondly, this is a convenient search, the presence of different types of filters, starting from the date and ending with different filters for specific authors, publications, topics, and so on. Also, the site is convenient in that it provides complete information about the research, allowing users to read the abstract, which is very helpful.

So our team, when developing the project, had to answer these questions:
• In which year is there a maximum number of cited articles? Who was a publisher ? 
• In which year is there a  minimum number of cited articles? Who was a publisher ? 
• Number of years and how many publications were published?
• What are the top newest articles?
• Which are the top oldest articles?
• What is the most cited article?

In the end, we answered all the questions by collecting the necessary data and analysing it.
