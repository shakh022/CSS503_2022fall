# Vision

In our time, there are a lot of still unresolved problems that arise every day, and to solve them, science and research are needed, which is aimed at understanding and substantiating knowledge. Therefore, scientific articles and research today remain an integral part of the scientific infrastructure. Being engaged in scientific activity, a person first receives a huge amount of information that has already been published, then, using the experience of previous researchers, he is looking for a solution to a specific problem. 
On the World Wide Web, you can find a very large number of studies, among them those that have not been officially published, as well as those that are not at all useful in promoting science. 
Studying one topic, it is impossible not only to analyze all previous works, but also to find well-done works. And young researchers who are just starting their way in science do not know where to start and in what areas they actively conduct research. We offer a solution that helps young scientists quickly and easily choose a scientific job. Thus, after sorting and collecting the database, we are going to make an analysis that will allow us to determine in which year which works were more relevant. In this way, we believe that it will be easier for scientists to know the trends and years of scientific work.


# Plan to reach vision

To achieve our goal, we have been looking for sites such as https://www.scribendi.com/academy/articles/free_online_journal_and_research_databases.en.html, https://www.sciencedirect.com/ . But there were disadvantages in them, that is that they are divided into sections and an inconvenient interface for scraping. After a few researches, we settled on one site that had a large database of scientific articles.
Thus, we found a site that suited us: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ . On this site you can find more than 5 million research data, in various directions. Here are collected all the studies that will help students like us in writing future dissertations in the magistracy and beyond.
